Information           : It is database interface library for Haskell that uses SQLite at the
                        backend. It has 2 advantages â€“ one is it make database strongly typed
                        and other is it avoids SQL Injections. We are also creating a Parser that
                        parses the SQL queries and uses the library to run these queries on
                        database.
